## MattBe - The Dev
I spend a lot of my time on this earth playing with and learning many things. Code is no exception. 

### [Smart Home - Home Assistant](ha.md)
I am a big fan of this smart home integration hub: [www.home-assistant.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
It's not code, it's yaml although there is a cool python ha API for more advance stuff. The docs are lacking at best so if i've scratched my head over something or got annoyed you can find an example here in case it helps someone else
